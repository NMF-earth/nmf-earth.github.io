# Hacktoberfest 2021

Do you want to contribute to a beautiful **React Native** app for hacktoberfest 2021? Search no more, help the fight against climate change right now.

## What is NMF.earth? 🌍

## What’s in for me? 🎁

In addition to digital ocean gift, I’ve tagged some issues like this [one](https://github.com/NMF-earth/nmf-app/issues/319) with a _Stickers_ tag. If you complete any of these issues, you will receive a set of 3 gorgeous stickers made by [Jenny Lelong](https://jenny-lelong.com/). Usually you can buy them [here](https://ko-fi.com/s/6f2a17f053), but this time it’s on me, from my own pocket, including the delivery.  
**Note**: If you have been working on a large task without the stickers tag but still want one, feel free to ask me for some free stickers there should be no problem 👍

## What is the goal of this hacktoberfest?

I would love to finish the [eco-score](https://github.com/NMF-earth/nmf-app/issues/269) feature (scan a bar code from a product to get its carbon footprint) and also complete the [recurring emissions](https://github.com/NMF-earth/nmf-app/issues/254) feature.  
Beside these two big features, there is also some smaller tasks like the language change [mechanism,](https://github.com/NMF-earth/nmf-app/issues/249) [FAQ](https://github.com/NMF-earth/nmf-app/issues/325) screen and some other tiny [issues](https://github.com/NMF-earth/nmf-app/labels/hacktoberfest) in the backlog.

## Contributions

Except if you already have merged some good code in this repo, I won’t assign any issue due to spam and beginners unable to complete a PR without a lot of help from my side — I do this app on my free time.  
However, feel free to leave a comment if you are working on an issue.

Happy hacking on [Github](https://github.com/NMF-earth/nmf-app) ✌️
